Prompts for Challenge 1
1. Use Standard Least Squares to fit curves to the given videos in each case. You
have to plot the data and your best fit curve for each case. Submit your code
along with the instructions to run it.
2. Compute the covariance matrix (from scratch) and find its eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. Plot the eigenvectors on the same graph as the data. Refer to this
article for better understanding. [10]
3. Fit a line to the data using linear least square method, total least square method
and RANSAC. Plot the result for each method and explain
drawbacks/advantages for each. [15]
4. Briefly explain all the steps of your solution and discuss which would be a better
choice of outlier rejection technique for each case. [5]
5. Show mathematically how you will compute the Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) for the matrix A. [10]
6. Write python code to compute the SVD. [10]
