# Perception-For-Autonomous-Robots
Coursework in Computer Vision

Course expectation and subject area

This course offers a foundation in computer vision. The students will learn 
techniques  and  algorithms  that  can  be used  to  solve an  abundance  of 
perception  problems.  This  course  is  dedicated  to  anyone  interested  in 
giving their autonomous system (e.g. robot, autonomous driving car, or 
simply  a  smart  camera)  means  to  understand  their  surrounding  world. 
Throughout  the  projects  of  this  course  students  will  gain  hands-on 
experience  in  solving  real-life  problems  such  as  lane  detecting  for 
autonomous driving, computing velocities of moving objects, and building 
a 3D model of an object using 2D images from cameras. Moreover, students 
will gain experience with state-of-the-art tools such as programming using 
OpenCV and Python.
