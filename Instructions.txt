Problem 2:

- Run the python file named parabola_ball.py
- Make sure the videos are in the same folder
(videos not included in zip package to make submission easy)
- Run the python file as is, and you should see two plots saved as
figures in the folder

Problem 3:

- Run the python file named insurance_age.py
- The csv spreadsheet is included in the submission folder so code should run fine
- Go to the main() function and uncomment each function call that has been designed
for each method. The comments in the funciton should guide you
- each Method for the different parts of problem 3 should save a plot as a figure in
the directory folder

Problem 4:

- Run the python file named homography.py
- You should see the svd matrix in the terminal where columns 1 and 2 are arranged
as [array 1, array2] as column 1 and column 2 respectively in the vertical folder
